AB  - The latent transition analysis (LTA) model is a version of Latent Class Analysis (LCA) which is used in longitudinal data analysis. The goal of LTA is to examine the variation over time and to identify the association of repeated measures. LTA gives an elegant solution to study heterogeneous changes in longitudinal data. As a classic LCA, it assumes that the data consists of several unknown groups that have homogeneous choices. This paper aims to present a review of assess the performance of LTA to identify the differences in longitudinal differences among unobserved classes. An example of LTA application in educational assessment was developed to illustrate the process and to explore the change among the time in reading comprehension.

T2  - Psychological Bulletin
AB  - Examines research on the relation between attitude and behavior in light of the correspondence between attitudinal and behavioral entities. Such entities are defined by their target, action, context, and time elements. A review of available empirical research supports the contention that strong attitude–behavior relations are obtained only under high correspondence between at least the target and action elements of the attitudinal and behavioral entities. This conclusion is compared with the rather pessimistic assessment of the utility of the attitude concept found in much contemporary social psychological literature.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly modified the lifestyle of a large portion of the population around the world. This pandemic is also the first one in decades that has severely impacted many countries of the Global North. Governments have had to adopt wide-scope and desperate measures to face the abnormal situation and to reduce the stress of their health care systems. These measures have been based on reducing the physical-social interaction and mobility (closing schools and some economic activities, or fostering telework, among others), increasing the physical distance between people, and recommending washing hands frequently and wearing masks. Thus, the COVID-19 may change many habits of people and the ways we interact with others after the current pandemic. It would also imply changes in mobility habits. Many questions arise about the willingness and acceptability of changes, and who would have to impulse them and how. This paper aims to study and understand individuals' acceptability towards a set of generic measures related to urban mobility in Spain, one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we conducted an online survey during the lockdown in Spring (2020). More than 75% of respondents would accept restrictions on car use after the return to normal, and more than 90% agree on increasing the space for pedestrians and cyclists on streets. Furthermore, 75% of respondents would change the primary transport mode towards a more sustainable transport mode if it would decrease the incidence or severity of the COVID-19. These results show that the respondents are overall in favor of a new urban hierarchy that gives more importance to the most sustainable modes, reducing the public space devoted to the car, which means the possibility of turning the COVID-19 crisis into an opportunity to make Spanish cities more sustainable.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine influences on active commuting (AC) behavior using a social ecological framework. METHODS: Participants (N = 1234) responded to an online survey about AC patterns and social ecological influences on AC. Multiple regression analysis determined the relative influence of individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and environmental levels on AC. RESULTS: Significant relationships were found between AC and individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and environmental influences; 70% of the variance in AC was explained with the full model. CONCLUSIONS: The social ecological model provides a framework for understanding a range of influences on AC and should inform strategies to improve AC behavior.

AB  - The paper describes research activities of monitoring, modeling, and planning of people mobility in Rome during the Covid-19 epidemic period from March to June 2020. The results of data collection for different transport modes (walking, bicycle, car, and transit) are presented and analyzed. A specific focus is provided for the subway mass transit, where 1 m interpersonal distancing is required to prevent the risks for Covid-19 contagion together with the use of masks and gloves. A transport system model has been calibrated on the data collected during the lockdown period –when people's behavior significantly changed because of smart-working adoption and contagion fear– and was applied to predict future mobility scenarios under different assumptions on economic activities restarting. Based on the estimations of passenger loading, a timing policy that differentiates the opening hours of the shops depending on their commercial category was implemented, and an additional bus transit service was introduced to avoid incompatible loads of the subway lines with the required interpersonal distancing.

AU  - Currie, Graham
AU  - Jain, Taru
AU  - Aston, Laura
T2  - Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice
AB  - This paper addresses the question, “Will post-pandemic travel behaviour, when the virus has gone, be different to pre-pandemic travel?”. It adopts an online survey where respondents were asked to report changes in travel during the various stages of the pandemic and expectations of future travel after the virus has gone. The paper focusses on commuting including total commuting, work from home (WFH), employment, travel mode volume and share and timing of morning commute trips using reported behaviour during pandemic shutdowns; and expectations of commuting when the virus has gone. The paper provides evidence that travel behaviour post-pandemic might be different to pre-pandemic travel. It suggests that after the pandemic, public transport ridership, which declined steeply during the pandemic, will return but not to pre-pandemic levels. A post-pandemic reduction effect of around 20% in transit commuting is expected. This effect is supported using secondary evidence from a number of international cities. Results imply a mode shift from public transport use to car driving; this will be particularly large for CBD/downtown areas and is likely to result in peak period traffic congestion after the virus has gone. Work from home increased substantially during the pandemic; this will reduce after the pandemic as enforced WFH is replaced by voluntary WFH. Nevertheless, a sustained future ongoing increase in WFH above pre-pandemic levels is suggested, acting to reduce peak commuting by 6% and commuting to Melbourne CBD by 20%. However, reductions in commuting due to WFH do not offset mode shift from public transport to car driving resulting in a net increase in car use after the pandemic. Infection fear is a new top concern of public transport users since the pandemic. This fear has transitioned from ‘fresh infection fear’; the initial concerns when the pandemic started to ‘residual infection fear’; a long-term effect when the virus has gone. Implications of the findings for research and practice are discussed.

TI  - Individual, social, and environmental factors associated with active transportation commuting during the COVID-19 pandemic
AU  - Cusack, Meagan
T2  - Journal of transport & health
AB  - Objective Physical inactivity is a major public health concern. Though active transportation through bicycling and walking can increase physical activity and thereby positively affect health, factors that influence people's decisions to commute using active transportation modes remain underexplored and often fail to capture equity-related barriers. Increases in active transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic call for a better understanding of these influences. This study examines the commute mode choices of essential workers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA to explore the extent to which active transportation to work is explained by individual, social, and environmental factors and whether active transportation choices reflect inequalities. Methods Drawing on the theory of planned behavior and the social-ecological model, this study utilizes data from an online survey (N = 213) completed between June and August 2020. Bivariate analyses compare respondents who commuted using active transportation modes to those who did not using chi-square and ANOVA tests. A series of logistic regression models using forward stepwise selection, controlling for demographic characteristics and commute distance, identify salient individual, social, and environmental factors associated with active transportation. Results Nearly half of respondents changed their commute mode during the pandemic, most often to limit exposure to COVID-19. The full model, accounting for 54% of variation in active transportation commuting, indicated significantly lower odds of active transportation use among non-white (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.155) respondents and those who reported time constraints (OR: 0.450), concerns about safety from traffic (OR: 0.482), and greater satisfaction with community support for bicycling and pedestrian issues (OR: 0.551) and significantly higher odds among those who reported safety concerns around germs (OR: 1.580). Conclusions Structural and social investments that make bicycling and walking safer commuting alternatives during COVID-19 could protect essential works and contribute to sustained behavior change. Community engagement is essential for implementation efforts.

AB  - As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, in spring 2020 numerous protective measures were taken in Germany and all over the world. This has changed our everyday life and our mobility considerably. It is in question whether and how the pandemic and the lockdown have impacted transport mode use, attitudes towards transport modes and the ownership of individual mobility options during the lockdown period. In order to shed light on these essential aspects of transport policy, we carried out a representative travel survey in Germany during the strictest period of lockdown in the beginning of April. We have analysed overall and individual changes in transport mode usage and attitudes towards transport modes, focussing on the bicycle, the car and public transport. Also, the changes in the perception of individual mobility options with a focus on car-free households were investigated. Our results indicate that public transport lost ground during the particularly restricted period of lockdown while individual modes of transport, especially the private car, became more important. Our findings are highly relevant for transport policy when developing measures for expanding the possibilities for sustainable individual transport and developing concepts that strengthen public transport. These aspects are key for achieving a sustainable transport system in the medium- and long-term despite the coronavirus pandemic.

AB  - In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, scholars across all domains of science and engineering mobilised their efforts to address its far-reaching societal problems. Transportation researchers were no exemption. With mobility restrictions being front and centre of the pandemic, many researchers shifted their focus to this issue, and as a result, a new cohort of transportation science was developed within a short period of time. Here, we examine more than 400 studies related to the COVID-19 pandemic published across transportation journals during 2020 and 2021. The aim is (i) to scope this newly developed segment of transportation research, (ii) outline the diversity of pandemic-related issues across various divisions of the transportation field and (iii) provide a roadmap for the continuation of this line of research. Common themes in pandemic research within the transportation field are identified and existing congruence and discrepancies across findings are discussed. The study also highlights how pandemic-related topics across different domains of transportation research can be interconnected and have implications for another, requiring a holistic integrative overview. Results show that no pre-pandemic study was particularly instrumental in the development of this section of transportation literature, and that, it can be considered a nearly independent body of transportation science. It is expected that the outcomes of this work will contribute to systematising this segment of the literature and provide insights about areas where research has been produced to near saturation, as well as areas that need most attention from transportation researchers, particularly moving forward and coming out of the pandemic.

T2  - Journal of Chiropractic Medicine
AB  - Objective Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.

AU  - Leone, Luigi

T2  - European Journal of Social Psychology
AB  - Abstract The theory of reasoned action (TRA; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975), the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1985) and the theory of self-regulation (TSR; Bagozzi, 1992) were applied to Italian undergraduate students' studying behavior. The main focus of the research was to ascertain the predictive power of past behavior on intention and behavior and thus test for the sufficiency of the theories. For theory sufficiency to be demonstrated, past behavior influences on intention and present behavior should be totally mediated by the focal variables of the theories (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and desire). It is argued that past behavior affects intentions and present behavior over and above attitudinal variables and that these effects will be weaker on intention for the TPB and TSR models. A structural equation approach was used to test the construct validity of measures such as the predictive validity of the theories. A total sample of 240 Italian college students participated in the research. A subsample of 90 subjects provided a self-report behavioral measure one week later. Results show that past behavior is a strong predictor of both intention and behavior in the TRA model, while it is a weaker predictor of intention in the TPB and in the TSR models. Implications for attitude–behavior relationships are discussed. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Compared the predictive validities of 3 models of attitudes and behavioral decisions: M. Rosenberg's (1956) instrumentality-value model, M. Fishbein's (see PA, Vol 38:5939; 1967; Fishbein and I. Ajzen, 1965) belief-evaluation model, and L. R. Beach and colleagues' (see PA, Vols 56:9766 and 51:12072) adaptation of subjective expected utility theory. 70 female undergraduates rated each of the models' components and reported their attitudes and behavioral plans toward using 3 methods of contraception. With the traditional across-Ss prediction procedure, the Rosenberg model generally accounted for 5–25% less variance in Ss' attitudes and behavioral plans than the Fishbein and Beach models, which were not different. With a within-S prediction procedure, the Rosenberg model was again the least accurate, and the Fishbein and Beach models had similar predictive accuracy. As hypothesized, within-S predictions were more accurate than across-Ss predictions. The relatively poor performance of the Rosenberg model was attributable to the instrumentality component. It was also found that the Beach model could be simplified with no appreciable loss in predictive accuracy. An S's personal normative beliefs emerged as a strong independent predictor of behavioral plan. (24 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Transport disrupted – Substituting public transport by bike or car under Covid 19
AU  - Schaefer, Kerstin J.

T2  - Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice
AB  - The Covid 19 pandemic has caused dramatic disruptions in the public transport sector that has seen a stark downturn in many cities across the globe, calling into question previous efforts to reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions by expanding this sector. Especially, the current surge of individual car use is worrying and the question remains which users might be able and willing to substitute public transport by cycling. This effect is interesting to study for the case of Hanover Region, because of the well-developed biking infrastructure that makes biking a viable alternative to individual car use. In this paper, we analyze survey data from June 2020 on the use of transportation modes before and during the pandemic in the Hanover Region. We ask if and how the over 4.000 participants substitute public transport and what characterizes those who chose biking over individual car use. We use multivariate regression models and find evidence that Stadtbahn (local light rail) and bus are substituted by bike, car and working from home, while train use is not significantly replaced by car and seems to be positively related to bike use. The data also shows that women have a higher level of fear of infection than men have during public transport use and therefore reduce public transport use more. Moreover, income displays a positive effect on increased car use while cycling is independent of socio-economic indicators but instead driven by the eco-consciousness of users. Surprisingly, we find that car use was increased in particular by residents of Hanover city, while it was decreased by residents of less densely populated urban areas in the region.

T2  - Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives
AB  - The mobility sector was one of the sectors most affected by COVID-19 and its political restrictions, with, inter alia a huge drop in mobility behavior due to travel bans, lockdowns, and a reduced need to be mobile. The present study examined the potential of COVID-19 restrictions aiming at containing the spread of the virus to be a window of opportunity for the transition toward sustainable mobility by breaking up strongly habitualized daily and travel mobility behaviors through changes of behavioral contexts. We conducted an online survey in a sample representative for the German population (N = 3092) to study the consequences of the COVID-19 restrictions on Germans’ daily and travel mode choices and on their wishes for future mobility. Furthermore, we examined the moderating effects of Germans’ personal norms to protect the climate on changes in their mobility behavior toward sustainable mobility, both within and beyond the corona pandemic. In line with previous research, the present study shows an overall reduction of mobility across almost all modes of transport for daily and travel mobility during time periods of COVID-19 restrictions compared to pre-COVID-19-times, with different transport modes being affected differently. Our findings additionally point out the relevance of personal norms to protect the climate for the transition toward sustainable mobility behavior. Altogether, the present study provides first empirical evidence for the corona pandemic to represent a window of opportunity for the transition toward sustainable mobility. Furthermore, the study also points out relevant directions for further research.

AB  - Background Leisure time physical activity (LTPA) provides both health benefits and risks, particularly during a pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, significant increases in close-to-home LTPA raised concerns for public health and land managers alike. This project illustrates a novel, integrated monitoring approach to estimating COVID-19 risk exposure during trail-related LTPA, with implications for other public spaces. Methods COVID-19 risk exposure was conservatively calculated from the integration of in-person observations of LTPA trail groups and automated monitoring of trail traffic volumes in spring 2020. Trained observers tracked 1,477 groups. Traffic volume estimates and observed distance data were integrated, considering occlusion and total trail traffic volume. Results 70% of groups had one or more encounters. Among individual users, 38.5% were 100% compliant across all events observed but 32.7% were not compliant. Considering trail traffic volumes and annual daily traffic volume, exposure to risk of COVID-19 was conservatively estimated at 61.5% among individual trail users. Conclusions Monitoring opportunities and challenges of health risk exposure exist. Adjusted exposure measures based on volume counts can approximate numbers of unique individuals exposed, inform management actions, efficacy and policy decisions.

AU  - Schwanen, Tim

T2  - Journal of Transport Geography
AB  - With the emergence of behaviour change on political and intellectual agendas in passenger transport, the question of how to understand and intervene in habitual carbon-intensive travel practices has become crucially important. Building primarily on the philosophies of Félix Ravaisson and John Dewey, we outline an approach to travel habits that is more affirmative than prevailing psychological perspectives. Rather than as the automatically cued, repetitive behaviour of individuals, habit is understood here as a generative and propulsive capacity brought about through repetition and belonging to body–mind–world assemblages that exceed the human individual as conventionally understood. The implications of the proposed conceptualisation of habits for behaviour change are also explored. We argue that widespread, durable behaviour change is unlikely to result from the displacement of automaticity by reasoned action alone but instead demands changes in collective customs. Additionally, a narrow focus on breaking carbon-intensive travel habits should be avoided. Not only should the formation of low-carbon habits and associated forms of embodied intelligence be stimulated; it is also important to capitalise on the potential for subtle change inherent to carbon-intensive travel habits in situations where individualised vehicular travel is the only realistic transport option.

AU  - Scorrano, Mariangela

T2  - Research in Transportation Economics
AB  - The paper investigates the choice of the transport mode to access the city center of Trieste, Italy. We have collected revealed and stated choice data and attitudinal data in order to investigate the mode of transport used before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. We studied the main choice determinants jointly with respondents’ psychological attitudes using an integrated choice/latent variable modelling framework. The model incorporates choice data, generalized cost variables, random parameters, and latent variables. The latter capture the concern for the environment, both at global and local level, the attitudes towards physical exercise and the Covid-19-related risks. The model is applied to assess the impact of extending the density of the cycling lanes on active mobility. Our estimates indicate a potential increase in cycling which, however, would not translate into an increase in active mobility, since the bike would substitute some trips currently made by foot. We also detect a high substitutability between the bike and the bus, while the motorcycle and the car are much less affected. It is confirmed that the Covid-19 pandemic altered significantly the transport mode choices, having a strong negative impact on bus and shifting bus users towards private modes, both motorized and non-motorized.

AU  - Shaer, Amin

T2  - Journal of transport & health
AB  - Aims Since active mobility is essential for older adults’ health and well-being, especially in crises, this study aims to investigate and compare factors affecting active mode choice of older adults (AMCOA) in the pre- and post-COVID-19 outbreak and evaluate changes in their active mobility behavior and no research has been conducted this subject. Methodology The sample study of this cross-sectional study includes individuals over 60 years old residing in Isfahan, Iran. For interviews based on a structured questionnaire, which was drafted based on reviewing the literature, 453 participants were randomly selected in 15 municipality districts of Isfahan. A binary logistic regression model was used to analyze the data. Result and Discussion The results indicate that in the post-outbreak the average walking duration per week decreased from 59 to 29 min; while, the share of this mode has increased from 40% to 65%. Also, the share of bicycles and the average cycling duration per week increased from 9% to 18% and from 9 to 15 min, respectively. Moreover, trip frequency, bicycle ownership, quality of walking and cycling routes, intersections safety, neighborhood security and greenery, traffic calming, CBD accommodation, and public transportation accessibility have positive effects on AMCOA; while, trip distance and vehicle ownership affect negatively. The results reveal that older adults have turned to the bicycle for most of their long trips during the pandemic because it is not subjected to traffic restrictions. Besides, the findings show that increasing bicycle ownership and improving bike-sharing infrastructure make the bicycle a resilient alternative when public transportation and private vehicles are not efficient. Conclusion Policymakers and urban planners should consider that an elderly-friendly neighborhood with mixed, dense, and accessible land uses and services, as well as safe and secure routes can increase older adults’ active mobility in the crises. Aims Since active mobility is essential for older adults’ health and well-being, especially in crises, this study aims to investigate and compare factors affecting active mode choice of older adults (AMCOA) before and during the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak and evaluate changes in their active mobility behavior and no research has been conducted this subject.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic required employees and businesses across the world to rapidly transition to work from home over extended periods, reaching what is likely the upper bound of telework in many sectors. Past studies have identified both advantages and disadvantages of teleworking. The pandemic experience offers a unique opportunity to examine employees’ experiences and perceptions of telework given the broad participation duration and extent. While employer strategies will play a major role in defining the future forms and adoption of telework, employee preferences and constraints, such as access to appropriate technology to work from home or the home environment, are also going to be important factors. Using data from a U.S. representative sample of 318 working adults, this study uses a Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause Model (MIMIC) to understand employee satisfaction with telework. The presented model links telework satisfaction with experienced and perceived benefits and barriers related to telework, and hence provide a causal structure to our understanding of telework satisfaction. We also present an ordered probit model without latent variables that help us understand the systematic heterogeneity in telework satisfaction across various socio-demographic groups. The results suggest younger and older aged individuals experienced/perceived lower benefits and higher barriers to teleworking compared to middle aged individuals. The results also suggest a disproportionate impact on Hispanic or Latino and Black respondents as well as on those with children attending online school from home. Accordingly, this study highlights important factors impacting telework adoption that employers and policy makers should consider in planning future work arrangements and policies in a post-pandemic world.

AU  - Zhang, Yunchang
AU  - Fricker, Jon D.
T2  - Transport Policy
AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in widespread impacts in the transportation sector due to containment measures. To better manage transportation during the COVID-19 crisis and improve future pre-pandemic planning, it is essential that we understand sufficiently the impact of the global epidemic on vehicle miles traveled, freight movement, and human mobility. The availability of pedestrian and bicycle count data allows us to estimate the causal impact of COVID-19 on non-motorized travel patterns. To quantify the causal effects of COVID-19, a Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model is proposed, with the “treatment” date defined as the date on which the national emergency was declared. The model is intended to (1) account for variations in local trends, seasonality and exogeneous covariates before the treatment, (2) make predictions about the counterfactual trends after the treatment, (3) infer the causal effects between observed series and counterfactual series, and (4) evaluate the uncertainty about the causal inference. The BSTS model is applied to quantify the drops or increases in non-motorized activities. Whereas most previous studies use citywide data, this study is based on data collected from count sites on 12 pedestrian-bicycle trails in 11 cities in the United States. The model validation demonstrates the reliability of the prediction of counterfactual variables. According to the estimation results, COVID-19 led to losses in non-motorized activities in densely populated cities, but walking and bicycle activities in less densely populated cities increased. In two cities studied, trends in non-motorized activities reversed about 10–20 days after the first confirmed case of COVID-19. The estimation results provide a snapshot of how walking and bicycling activities have been affected by COVID-19 in different types of cities. This information can help policymakers design post-pandemic strategies and undertake future pre-pandemic planning.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a rapid and significant impact on mobility. One of the most important responses of countries worldwide to slow the spread of the pandemic is to restrict the movement of people, which has had a considerable effect on transport systems. However, the reduction of transport is not identical for all modes of transport: public transport has seen the greatest decline so far. Understanding urban modal share developments during a pandemic situation can help cities better prepare for transport management in the future.

TI  - The effect of COVID-19 and subsequent social distancing on travel behavior
AU  - De Vos, Jonas
T2  - Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives
AB  - The spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in unprecedented measures restricting travel and activity participation in many countries. Social distancing, i.e., reducing interactions between individuals in order to slow down the spread of the virus, has become the new norm. In this viewpoint I will discuss the potential implications of social distancing on daily travel patterns. Avoiding social contact might completely change the number and types of out-of-home activities people perform, and how people reach these activities. It can be expected that the demand for travel will reduce and that people will travel less by public transport. Social distancing might negatively affect subjective well-being and health status, as it might result in social isolation and limited physical activity. As a result, walking and cycling, recreationally or utilitarian, can be important ways to maintain satisfactory levels of health and well-being. Policymakers and planners should consequently try to encourage active travel, while public transport operators should focus on creating ways to safely use public transport.

AU  - Kanda, Wisdom

T2  - Energy Research & Social Science
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a major landscape shock that is having pervasive effects across socio-technical systems. Due to its recentness, sustainability scientists and other researchers have only started to investigate the implications of this crisis. The COVID-19 outbreak presents a unique opportunity to analyze in real time the effects of a protracted landscape-scale perturbation on the trajectories of sustainability transitions. In this perspective, we explore the ramifications for sustainability transition research on electricity and mobility, drawing from selected examples in Finland and Sweden. The long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to trigger more permanent changes connected to the digitalization of work and other daily activities, thus reducing mobility needs and overall fossil-energy consumption. The crisis may encourage governance systems to be better prepared for different types of shocks in the future, while it also contains a threat of increasingly populist or undemocratic political responses and increased securitization. These developments can guide research by addressing the reproduction of new practices arising from the COVID-19 outbreak to accelerate sustainability transitions, enhancing understanding of the role of governance in transitions, and bringing to attention the ethical and political implications of landscape shocks.

AU  - de Haas, Mathijs

T2  - Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives
AB  - COVID-19 has massively affected the lives of people all over the world. This paper presents first insights in current and potential future effects of the virus and the Dutch government's ‘intelligent lockdown’ on people's activities and travel behaviour. Findings are based on a representative sample of about 2500 respondents from the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN). We show that approximately 80% of people reduced their activities outdoors, with a stronger decrease for older people. 44% of workers started or increased the amount of hours working from home and 30% have more remote meetings. Most of these workers report positive experiences. Students and school pupils, however, are mostly not happy with following education from home. Furthermore, the amount of trips and distance travelled dropped by 55% and 68% respectively when compared to the fall of 2019. So-called ‘roundtrips’ (e.g. a walking or cycling tour) gained in popularity. People are currently more positive towards the car and far more negative towards public transport. Changes in outdoor activities seem to be temporal, with over 90% of people who currently reduced their outdoor activities not expecting to continue this behaviour in the future after corona. However, 27% of home-workers expect to work from home more often in the future. In addition, 20% of people expect to cycle and walk more and 20% expect to fly less in the future. These findings show that the coronavirus crisis might result in structural behavioural changes, although future longitudinal analyses are needed to observe these possible structural effects.

TI  - Cycling for transport and public health: a systematic review of the effect of the environment on cycling
AU  - Fraser, Simon D.S.
AU  - Lock, Karen
T2  - European Journal of Public Health
AB  - Background: Active transport policies are being developed across Europe designed to have health and environmental benefits. There is little evidence of impact on physical activity of active transport strategies which modify the built environment. Cycling represents one virtually carbon-neutral form of transport that can help to address declining levels of exercise. Methods: A systematic literature review of experimental or observational studies that objectively evaluated the effect of the built environment on cycling. Results: A total of 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, all of which were observational studies. Eleven studies identified objectively measured environmental factors with a significant positive association with cycling. The environmental factors identified as being positively associated with cycling included presence of dedicated cycle routes or paths, separation of cycling from other traffic, high population density, short trip distance, proximity of a cycle path or green space and for children projects promoting ‘safe routes to school’. Negative environmental factors were perceived and objective traffic danger, long trip distance, steep inclines and distance from cycle paths. Of the seven studies which focused primarily on the impact of cycle routes, four demonstrated a statistically significant positive association. Conclusion: Although the study identified environmental factors with positive and negative associations with cycling behaviour, many other types of environmental policies and interventions have yet to be rigorously evaluated. Policies promoting cycle lane construction appear promising but the socio-demographic distribution of their effects on physical activity is unclear. The wider impact of active transport policies on health and inequalities across Europe must be explored.

This comprehensive review shows how specific details of the built environment enhance people's walking and cycling. This was accomplished through identifying the barriers to walking and cycling activities as well as the general and specific characteristics of the major physical built environment attributes within a residential neighborhood that can help overcome these barriers and enhance the walking and cycling activity levels. Also the effectiveness of some individual attributes was also compared. Of particular value of this study is that its structure and level of details of information laid out in this review can facilitate building designers and neighborhood planners in creating a supportive environment within residential neighborhoods.

AB  - Introduction
Cycling behavior has recently attracted great research attention as an important type of physical activity and sustainable mode of transportation. In addition, cycling provides other environmental benefits, such as reducing air pollution and traffic congestion. Various built environment factors have been demonstrated to be associated with the popularity of cycling behaviors. However, the most recent built environment cycling reviews were conducted nearly 10 years ago, and these reviews reached no clear consensus on which built environment factors are associated with which domain of cycling behaviors. To determine the crucial features of a cycling-friendly city, it is therefore necessary to conduct a review based on empirical studies from the last decade (2007–2017).
Methods
Thirty-nine empirical studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 2007 and 2017 were retrieved and reviewed. The results were summarized based on built environment factors and four domains of cycling behaviors (transport, commuting, recreation, and general). Weighted elasticity values for built environment factors were calculated to estimate effect sizes.
Results
We found consistent associations with large effect sizes between street connectivity and cycling for commuting and transport. The presence of cycling paths and facilities was found to be positively associated with both commuting cycling and general cycling. However, the effects of land-use mix, availability of cycling paths to non-residential destinations, and terrain slope on cycling behaviors remained weak. The effects of urban density and other built environment factors are mixed.
Conclusions
This review has demonstrated that street connectivity and the presence of cycling paths and facilities are the two most significant built environment factors that may promote cycling behaviors. With the emergence of advanced measurement methods for both the built environment and cycling behaviors, further studies may overcome current research limitations and provide robust evidence to support urban planning and public-health practice.

AB  - Background. This study aimed to investigate relationships between environmental aesthetics, convenience, and walking companions and walking for exercise or recreation and to investigate differences in these relationships by sex and by reported physical and mental health. Methods. Analyses of cross-sectional self-report data from a statewide population survey of 3,392 Australian adults were used. Results. Men and women reporting a less aesthetically pleasing or less convenient environment were less likely to report walking for exercise or recreation in the past 2 weeks. Those respondents, particularly women, reporting no company or pet to walk with were also less likely to walk for exercise or recreation. Associations with environmental and social influences were observed for men and women reporting both good and poor physical and mental health. Conclusions. Perceived environmental aesthetics and convenience and walking companions are important correlates of walking for exercise among urban Australians. Acknowledging the cross-sectional nature of these data, findings support a case for evaluation of environmental policies to promote physical activity.

AB  - Walking is an important source of outdoor physical activity among elderly people. In order to devise measures aimed at encouraging walking among the elderly it is important to understand how the local environment influences the walking behaviour of elderly people. Here, a model describing the influence of environmental street characteristics on the walking route choice of elderly people is presented. Techniques adapted from the field of transportation research were employed within the model. Data concerning the walking route choice to specific destinations reported by 364 independently living elderly residents (55–80 years) from three Dutch urban districts were collected. Route choice was modelled within a ‘Geographic Information System’ (GIS) database by using ‘resistance factors’ to describe the resistance to walking of street sections (i.e. links) within the street network. These factors were optimized by minimizing the difference between the estimated and the reported number of trips along each link. This is, to the authors' knowledge the first time that this technique has been applied within this context. The influence of link characteristics on link resistance was investigated by multivariate linear regression. The first results of the route choice model and the influence of street characteristics on route choice are reported and discussed.

AB  - Knowledge on the physical environmental factors that invite older adults to walk for transportation is limited. The current study aimed to investigate the relationships between environmental factors and invitingness to walk for transportation and the potential moderating effects of gender, functional limitations and current walking for transportation behavior. Sixty older participants evaluated 40 panoramic photographs on their invitingness in two ways: a forced choice (first impressions) and a rating task (more deliberate evaluation). Presence of vegetation, benches, and surveillance significantly positively related to both invitingness-measures. Upkeep and presence of historic elements significantly positively related to the assigned invitingness-ratings. For the forced choice task, significant positive relationships emerged for land use and separation between sidewalk and cycling path, but only in functionally limited participants. Environments offering comfort, safety from crime, and pleasantness may attract older adults to walk for transportation. Experimental and on-site studies are needed to elaborate on current findings.

AB  - Neighborhood supports have been associated with walking, but this association may be modified by reports about the usefulness of these supports for promoting walking. This study examined the association between reported presence of neighborhood supports and walking and whether usefulness modified this association in a nationwide sample of U.S. adults. Measures of reported presence and use or potential use (i.e., usefulness) of neighborhood supports (shops within walking distance, transit stops, sidewalks, parks, interesting things to look at, well-lit at night, low crime rate, and cars following speed limit) were examined in 3973 adults who completed the 2014 SummerStyles survey. Multinomial regression models were used to examine the association between presence of supports with walking frequency (frequently, sometimes, rarely (referent)) and the role usefulness had on this association. The interaction term between reported presence and usefulness was significant for all supports (p<0.05). For adults who reported a support as useful, a positive association between presence of the support and walking frequency was observed for all supports. For adults who did not report a support as useful, the association between presence of the support and walking frequency was null for most supports and negative for sidewalks, well-lit at night, and low crime rate. The association between presence of neighborhood supports and walking is modified by reported usefulness of the support. Tailoring initiatives to meet a community's supply of and affinity for neighborhood supports may help initiatives designed to promote walking and walkable communities succeed.

AB  - Background
Cycling for transportation has become an increasingly important component of strategies to address public health, climate change, and air quality concerns in urban centers. Within this context, planners and policy makers would benefit from an improved understanding of available interventions and their relative effectiveness for cycling promotion. We examined predictors of bicycle commuting that are relevant to planning and policy intervention, particularly those amenable to short- and medium-term action.
Methods
We estimated a travel mode choice model using data from a survey of 765 commuters who live and work within the municipality of Barcelona. We considered how the decision to commute by bicycle was associated with cycling infrastructure, bike share availability, travel demand incentives, and other environmental attributes (e.g., public transport availability). Self-reported and objective (GIS-based) measures were compared. Point elasticities and marginal effects were calculated to assess the relative explanatory power of the independent variables considered.
Results
While both self-reported and objective measures of access to cycling infrastructure were associated with bicycle commuting, self-reported measures had stronger associations. Bicycle commuting had positive associations with access to bike share stations but inverse associations with access to public transport stops. Point elasticities suggested that bicycle commuting has a mild negative correlation with public transport availability (−0.136), bike share availability is more important at the work location (0.077) than at home (0.034), and bicycle lane presence has a relatively small association with bicycle commuting (0.039). Marginal effects suggested that provision of an employer-based incentive not to commute by private vehicle would be associated with an 11.3% decrease in the probability of commuting by bicycle, likely reflecting the typical emphasis of such incentives on public transport.
Conclusions
The results provide evidence of modal competition between cycling and public transport, through the presence of public transport stops and the provision of public transport-oriented travel demand incentives. Education and awareness campaigns that influence perceptions of cycling infrastructure availability, travel demand incentives that encourage cycling, and policies that integrate public transport and cycling may be promising and cost-effective strategies to promote cycling in the short to medium term.

AB  - Objective
Built environment characteristics are closely related to transport behavior, but observed variations could be due to residents own choice of neighborhood called residential self-selection. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in neighborhood walkability and residential self-selection across life stages in relation to active transport behavior.
Methods
The IPEN walkability index, which consists of four built environment characteristics, was used to define 16 high and low walkable neighborhoods in Aarhus, Denmark (250.000 inhabitants). Transport behavior was assessed using the IPAQ questionnaire. Life stages were categorized in three groups according to age and parental status. A factor analysis was conducted to investigate patterns of self-selection. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the association between walkability and transport behavior i.e. walking, cycling and motorized transport adjusted for residential self-selection and life stages.
Results
A total of 642 adults aged 20–65 years completed the questionnaire. The highest rated self-selection preference across all groups was a safe and secure neighborhood followed by getting around easily on foot and by bicycle. Three self-selection factors were detected, and varied across the life stages. In the multivariable models high neighborhood walkability was associated with less motorized transport (OR 0.33 95% CI 0.18–0.58), more walking (OR 1.65 95% CI 1.03–2.65) and cycling (OR 1.50 95% CI 1.01–2.23). Self-selection and life stage were also associated with transport behavior, and attenuated the association with walkability.
Conclusion
This study supports the hypothesis that some variation in transport behavior can be explained by life stages and self-selection, but the association between living in a more walkable neighborhood and active transport is still significant after adjusting for these factors. Life stage significantly moderated the association between neighborhood walkability and cycling for transport, and household income significantly moderated the association between neighborhood walkability and walking for transport. Getting around easily by bicycle and on foot was the highest rated self-selection factor second only to perceived neighborhood safety.

T2  - Walking & Cycling: The contributions of health and transport geography
AB  - Despite the Netherlands’ position as a premier cycling country (mainly due to its high cycling mode share), there is scarce insight into the variations of bicycle use between different spatial and social contexts as well as changes and trends over time. This gap severely limits the understanding of the context-specific aspects of cycling trends and hinders the development of effective policies to promote cycling. In order to fill this gap, this paper explores the spatial and social differentiation of cycling patterns and trends in the Netherlands. First, an overview of the known spatial and social drivers of mobility behaviour in general, and of cycling behaviour in particular, is provided. Next, these insights are used to structure the analysis of data from the Dutch National Travel Survey (NTS). Mobility diaries allowed us to distinguish trends in mobility behaviour across different spatial contexts and social groups. Our findings revealed three important spatial and social differences in cycling patterns and trends. First, the spatial redistribution of the population towards urban areas (‘re-urbanisation’) has led to increasing aggregated cycling volumes in urban areas, and falling rates in rural areas. Second, the general mode share of cycling is mainly sensitive to changes in the composition of the population, especially elderly persons (higher rates) and immigrants (lower rates). Third, although per capita changes are minor, cycling shares among young adults living in urban areas and elderly baby boomers are growing. The results emphasizes the need for a differentiated approach to promoting cycling and developing policies that can respond to location- and group-specific threats and opportunities. An awareness of these spatial- and social differences is especially important when cycling is used as policy intervention for public health; some groups and places are likely to profit, while others might remain immune. Additional research is needed to further clarify the drivers behind the observed trends and to fine-tune the intervention strategies.

AB  - The transportation industry—particularly light-duty vehicles—is a significant contributor of greenhouse gasses, accounting for about one-third of overall emissions in the U.S. Research to date has studied various factors that impact travel behavior of residents with varying socio-economic characteristics. However, research on the socio-economic characteristics of residents and their impact on environmental burdens within a single urban region, as measured by fuel consumption and vehicular emissions, is recognized as under-represented in the U.S. planning and transportation literature. This study focuses on the Detroit region, Michigan, a unique case study due to the scale of suburbanization and urban decline, yet representative of many mid-western cities. The article explores how socio-economic characteristics impact travel patterns and environmental burdens within six Detroit region neighborhoods. Data on individual travel behavior and personal vehicle characteristics gathered from a mail survey enabled an analysis into how associated environmental burdens varied with socio-economic composition. The analysis explores contributions to environmental burdens between poorer urban and wealthier suburban populations.

AB  - Active mobility is related to various positive effects and is promoted in urban planning, transport planning, and in public health. The goals of these three disciplines differ in many respects but have a strong overlap in the ambition to foster active mobility. Until now, efforts for strengthening active mobility have typically not been combined, but rather promoted separately within each discipline. This paper presents a review of research on determinants and impacts of active mobility and of policy measures for supporting active mobility, including the three disciplines of transport planning, urban planning, and public health. The paper further shows the different perspectives and ambitions of the three disciplines and, simultaneously, the substantial synergies that can be gained from an interdisciplinary collaboration in research and practice.

T2  - Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice
AB  - This paper reviews trends in cycling levels, safety, and policies in Canada and the USA over the past two decades. We analyze aggregate data for the two countries as well as city-specific case study data for nine large cities (Chicago, Minneapolis, Montréal, New York, Portland, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, and Washington). Cycling levels have increased in both the USA and Canada, while cyclist fatalities have fallen. There is much spatial variation and socioeconomic inequality in cycling rates. The bike share of work commuters is more than twice as high in Canada as in the USA, and is higher in the western parts of both countries. Cycling is concentrated in central cities, especially near universities and in gentrified neighborhoods near the city center. Almost all the growth in cycling in the USA has been among men between 25–64years old, while cycling rates have remained steady among women and fallen sharply for children. Cycling rates have risen much faster in the nine case study cities than in their countries as a whole, at least doubling in all the cities since 1990. They have implemented a wide range of infrastructure and programs to promote cycling and increase cycling safety: expanded and improved bike lanes and paths, traffic calming, parking, bike-transit integration, bike sharing, training programs, and promotional events. We describe the specific accomplishments of the nine case study cities, focusing on each city’s innovations and lessons for other cities trying to increase cycling. Portland’s comprehensive package of cycling policies has succeeded in raising cycling levels 6-fold and provides an example that other North American cities can follow.

T2  - Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice
AB  - Heavy dependency on car use leads to traffic congestion, pollution, and physical inactivity, which impose high direct and indirect costs on society. Promoting walking and cycling has been recognised as one of the means of mitigating such negative effects. Various approaches have been taken to enhance walking and cycling levels and to reduce the use of automobiles. This paper examines the effectiveness of infrastructure interventions in promoting walking and cycling for transport. Two related sets of panel data, covering elapsed time periods of one and two years, were analysed to track changes in travel behaviour following provision of new walking and cycling infrastructure so that modal shift from private car use to walking and cycling can be investigated. Two types of exposure measures were tested: distance from the infrastructure (a measure of potential usage), and actual usage of the infrastructure. Only the latter measure was statistically significantly associated with modal shift. This in turn suggested that infrastructure provision was not a sufficient condition for modal shift, but may have been a necessary condition. Along with the use of new infrastructure, the loss of employment, higher education, being male and being part of the ethnic majority were consistently found to be significantly and positively associated with modal shift towards walking and cycling. The findings of this study support the construction of walking and cycling routes, but also suggest that such infrastructure alone may not be enough to promote active travel.

T2  - Walking and Cycling for better Transport, Health and the Environment
AB  - There is a growing recognition of the role that walking and cycling can make in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by substituting motorized travel, particularly on short trips. However, there is a lack of evidence at the micro level on the realistic, empirically derived potential of walking and cycling to displace motorized travel and thus reduce GHG emissions. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential for GHG emissions savings from replacing short car trips with walking and cycling and the extent to which high quality infrastructure for walking and cycling may influence day-to-day travel decisions, change the spatial and temporal nature of local journeys and impact on overall GHG emissions from motorised travel. To achieve this aim this study conducted an in-depth observational study of a purposively selected cohort of 50 residents in Cardiff, Wales. Using a mixed-method approach detailed quantitative and qualitative data were collected for each participant using personal Global Position System (GPS) devices, 7-day travel diaries and contextual interviews over two seasonally matching 7-day time periods in 2011 and 2012. GHG emissions for motorized travel modes were derived using journey distance, vehicle technology details and average speeds obtained from the GPS data. The spatial and contextual data provided new insights into the complexities of walking behaviour and factors influencing cycling for everyday travel or recreation, including route choice decisions, activity destinations and the role of the new infrastructure to enable change. We found significant potential of active travel to substitute short car trips, with sizeable impacts on carbon emissions from personal travel. Half of all car trips were less than 3 miles long. Taking into account individual travel patterns and constraints, walking or cycling could realistically substitute for 41% of short car trips, saving nearly 5% of CO2e emissions from car travel. This was on top of 5% of ‘avoided’ emissions from cars due to existing walking and cycling. The evolving high quality walking and cycling infrastructure in the case study area was unlikely to promote a significant reduction in carbon emissions from (displaced) car journeys on its own. The study contributes to the debate on how to achieve stringent low carbon targets in urban transport. The combination of methods for data collection developed and employed in this study also helps to inform future research on the wider environmental impacts of active travel, including ‘co-benefits’ of improved air quality, reduced noise and reduced fossil fuel use.

AB  - Various measures were recommended or imposed by the governments to control the spread of COVID-19. Travel behaviors are significantly influenced due to such measures. However, people have various travel needs ranging from grocery shopping to work. This study examines the changes that occurred in travel behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected through an online questionnaire survey that included questions on trip purpose, mode choice, distance traveled, and frequency of trips before and during COVID-19. 1203 responses were collected from various countries around the world. Results explained that trip purpose, mode choice, distance traveled, and frequency of trips for the primary travel were significantly different before and during the pandemic. Further, the majority of trips were made for shopping during the pandemic. There was a significant shift from public transport to private transport and non-motorized modes. People placed a higher priority on the pandemic related concerns while choosing a mode during the pandemic as compared to the general concerns. Gender, car ownership, employment status, travel distance, the primary purpose of traveling, and pandemic-related underlying factors during COVID-19 were found to be significant predictors of mode choice during the pandemic. Outcomes of this study could be useful in transport planning and policymaking during pandemics based on the travel needs of people. In particular, government authorities could utilize such knowledge for planning smart and partial lockdowns. Service providers, e.g., taxi companies and retailers, could use such information to better plan their services and operations.

AB  - As a reaction to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), countries around the globe have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus. The transportation sector is particularly affected by the pandemic situation. The current study aims to contribute to the empirical knowledge regarding the effects of the coronavirus situation on the mobility of people by (1) broadening the perspective to the mobility rural area’s residents and (2) providing subjective data concerning the perceived changes of affected persons’ mobility practices, as these two aspects have scarcely been considered in research so far.

AB  - Travel behavior has been affected around the world since the eruption of corona virus disease (COVID-19). Several industries including transportation industry have been hard hit by the pandemic. As the virus is transmitted through close contact with infected people, number of outdoor trips has reduced causing roads and public transport to be less crowded than before. In order to develop transport-related policies for the post COVID-19 world, it is necessary to explore how the pandemic has affected the travel behavior pattern. This study explored the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel pattern and mode preferences in Pakistan using a questionnaire survey. The results showed significant shift in primary traveling purpose from work and studying to shopping during the pandemic. Number of trips performed for non-commuting purposes were also significantly different before and during the pandemic. A significant modal shift from motorbike to non-motorized modes of travel was found for distances less than 5 km. For longer distances, people shifted from public transport to private car. These findings suggest that past policies regarding different modes may be revisited in the post COVID-19 world. The statistical tests performed on the factors affecting mode choices indicated that the respondents put more priority on pandemic-related items such as infection concern, social distance, hand sanitizers' availability, and cleanliness, etc., during the pandemic. The findings of this study will certainly help in shaping up the policies for the post COVID-19 world especially in the developing countries.

AB  - A model of travel mode choice is tested by means of a survey among 199 inhabitants of a village. Car choice behavior for a particular journey is predicted from the attitude toward choosing the car and the attitude toward choosing an alternative mode (i.e., train), on the one hand, and from general car habit, on the other hand. Unlike traditional measures of habit, a script-based measure was used. General habit was measured by travel mode choices in response to very global descriptions of imaginary journeys. In the model, habit is predicted from the degree of involvement with the decision-making about travel mode choice for the particular journey (decisional involvement) and from the degree of competition in a household with respect to car use. The model proves satisfactory. Moreover, as suggested by Triandis (1977), there is a tradeoff between attitude and habit in the prediction of behavior: When habit is strong the attitude-behavior relation is weak, whereas when habit is weak, the attitude-behavior link is strong.

T2  - European Journal of Social Psychology
AB  - Abstract Three studies examined the role of habit on information acquisition concerning travel mode choices. On the basis of Triandis' (1980) model of attitude?behaviour relations it was expected that habit strength attenuates the elaborateness of choice processes. The studies focused on different phases in the choice process, namely the appreciation of situational cues and appreciation of choice option information. In line with expectations, it was found that, compared to weak habit participants, those who had a strong habit towards choosing a particular travel mode acquired less information and gave evidence of less elaborate choice strategies. It was attempted to break effects of habit by manipulating either accountability demands or level of attention. Although accountability demands raised the level of information acquisition, no interactions with habit were found. Enhanced attention to the choice process initially did override habit effects in a series of choice trials. However, in spite of this manipulation, chronic habit effects emerged during later trials. The results demonstrate the profound effects that habit may have on the appreciation of information about choice situations and choice options. ?1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T2  - Journal of Environmental Psychology
AB  - In the present paper, automaticity in habitual travel mode choice behaviour was investigated. Expanding on the idea that habits are mentally represented, it was proposed that when travel behaviour is habitual, activation of a travel goal automatically activates a travel mode in memory. In an experiment, participants were presented with travel goals (e.g. having to go to the university) and asked to mention a transport mode. The typical travel mode choice for those destinations was either permitted, or not permitted under conditions of cognitive load or not. Results showed that suppressing habitual responses is difficult, and often not successful under conditions of cognitive load, indicating that a transport mode choice can become automatically associated with travel goals.

AB  - Landscape architecture is the design of outdoor and public spaces to achieve environmental, socio-behavioral, and/or aesthetic outcomes. It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and geological conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome. The scope of the profession includes: urban design; site planning; town or urban planning; environmental restoration; parks and recreation planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private estate and residence landscape master planning and design - all at varying scales of design, planning and management. This book contains chapters on recent developments in studies of landscape architecture. For this reason I believe the book would be useful to the relevant professional disciplines.

AB  - Physical inactivity poses concern for health risks among all groups in the United States. Active transportation (AT) (e.g., bicycling) is one way of being physically active and may be helpful in promoting physical activity. This study characterized active transportation behavior among college students using the Theory of Planned Behavior. This study sought to describe predictors, including Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs, of AT behavior among college students at a large Midwest university. Students were recruited through the university registrar's office and e-mailed an electronic survey. Differences among AT users were determined using t-tests, and predictors of AT were identified using regression analysis. Significant differences between AT users for all TPB constructs were observed. Regression analysis using only TPB constructs accounted for 11.58% explained variation in AT use. Other variables added to the model resulted in 44.44% explained variation in AT use. The final model included subjective norms, age, perceived behavioral control, and transportation type and destination. The results of this research are insightful in explaining AT behavior. Perceived norms and the level of control students had regarding their method of transportation were important contributions to AT use. These results may be applied to promoting physical activity in community health.

AB  - Employee attendance at a training session was examined using the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). In addition, based on Audi (1973a, b) and Warshaw and Davis (1985), a distinction was made between desires (I want) and behavioral self-predictions (I will), and as in Ajzen (1985, 1987), the role of perceived control as a determinant of these desires, self-predictions, and attendance behavior, per se, was investigated. The results indicated that the best predictors of attendance at the training session were one's desire or motivation to attend the training session and the extent to which one perceived pressure from his or her supervisor to do so. Consistent with the theory of reasoned action, the motivation to attend training was predicted accurately from attitudes and subjective norms (R=.76, p < .001). Moreover, these attitudes and subjective norms were themselves predicted from a consideration of behavioral and normative beliefs, and key beliefs underlying one's desire to attend were identified. However, a consideration of perceived control did not improve the prediction of one's desire to attend training, and neither perceived control nor behavioral self-predictions improved prediction of actual attendance. The discussion focused on the roles of perceived control and different measures of intention in behavioral prediction.

A2  - Kuhl, Julius

AB  - There appears to be general agreement among social psychologists that most human behavior is goal-directed (e. g., Heider, 1958 ; Lewin, 1951). Being neither capricious nor frivolous, human social behavior can best be described as following along lines of more or less well-formulated plans. Before attending a concert, for example, a person may extend an invitation to a date, purchase tickets, change into proper attire, call a cab, collect the date, and proceed to the concert hall. Most, if not all, of these activities will have been designed in advance; their execution occurs as the plan unfolds. To be sure, a certain sequence of actions can become so habitual or routine that it is performed almost automatically, as in the case of driving from home to work or playing the piano. Highly developed skills of this kind typically no longer require conscious formulation of a behavioral plan. Nevertheless, at least in general outline, we are normally well aware of the actions required to attain a certain goal. Consider such a relatively routine behavior as typing a letter. When setting this activity as a goal, we anticipate the need to locate a typewriter, insert a sheet of paper, adjust the margins, formulate words and sentences, strike the appropriate keys, and so forth. Some parts of the plan are more routine, and require less conscious thought than others, but without an explicit or implicit plan to guide the required sequence of acts, no letter would get typed.

AB  - [We argue that attitudes and subjective norms are not sufficient determinants of intentions and that intentions are not a sufficient impetus for action, as maintained by leading theories of attitude. To deepen attitude theory, we address the role of cognitive and emotional self-regulatory mechanisms. The attitude-intention link is hypothesized to depend on conative processes and on certain coping responses directed at the emotional significance of evaluative appraisals. The subjective norm-intention relationship is hypothesized to be governed by certain cognitive activities inherent in perspective taking and by positive and negative emotional reactions associated with appraisals of the deviation and conformance of both the self and others to expectations concerning the shared social meaning of a focal act. Finally, the intention-behavior relationship, particularly for goal-directed behaviors, is posited to be conditioned on decision making with respect to the means needed to achieve a goal; with respect to implementation processes related to planning, monitoring, and guidance and control of instrumental acts; and with respect to motivational processs associated with commitment, effort, and affect toward the means.]

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted billions of people around the world. To capture some of these impacts in the United States, we are conducting a nationwide longitudinal survey collecting information about activity and travel-related behaviors and attitudes before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey questions cover a wide range of topics including commuting, daily travel, air travel, working from home, online learning, shopping, and risk perception, along with attitudinal, socioeconomic, and demographic information. The survey is deployed over multiple waves to the same respondents to monitor how behaviors and attitudes evolve over time. Version 1.0 of the survey contains 8,723 responses that are publicly available. This article details the methodology adopted for the collection, cleaning, and processing of the data. In addition, the data are weighted to be representative of national and regional demographics. This survey dataset can aid researchers, policymakers, businesses, and government agencies in understanding both the extent of behavioral shifts and the likelihood that changes in behaviors will persist after COVID-19.

Data were collected on individual commuting routes between home and work. Additional data collected include age and gender characteristics. Frequency analysis in a geographic information system compared the number of common street segments among actual and alternative routes to determine cyclists? use of existing street facilities. Findings are reported for actual routes compared with shortest distance, shortest time, and safest route alternatives on street facilities between the same origin and destination. Spatial analysis identified local gaps in arterial street bicycle facilities at municipal boundaries. These findings include evidence that cyclists adjust their routes to use current street bicycle facilities, and suggest that policy makers should concentrate on linking bicycle facilities across jurisdictions.

TI  - Trips for outdoor exercise at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland

T2  - Journal of Transport & Health
AB  - Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had exceptional effects on travel behaviour in the UK. This paper focuses specifically on the outdoor exercise trips of Scottish residents at several distinct points of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the negative health consequences of limited exercise, this study aims to determine the sociodemographic and behavioural factors affecting frequency of outdoor exercise trips.
Methods
Using recent public survey data (n=6000), random parameters ordered probit models (with allowances for heterogeneity in the means of random parameters) are estimated for three points during the pandemic: the most stringent lockdown, modest restriction easing and further easing of restrictions.
Results
The survey data show frequent outdoor exercise in the early stages of the pandemic, with ∼46% making six or more weekly trips during lockdown, reducing to ∼39% during the first phase of restriction easing, and further to ∼34% during the following phase of easing. The model estimations show that common factors, dominated by socioeconomic and demographic variables, influenced the frequency of outdoor exercise trips across most survey groups. The modelling framework also allowed insights into the impact of unobserved characteristics within several independent variables; for example, the lockdown exercise trip rates of those with a health problem or disability, and those over 65, were both found to be dependent on personal vehicle access.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that those with a health problem or disability, those who live in households’ where the main income earner is employed in a semi-skilled/unskilled manual occupation or is unemployed and ethnic minority groups (i.e., any mixed, Asian, or Black background) were significantly more likely to complete no weekly outdoor exercise trips throughout the pandemic. As a result, we suggest that these groups are at higher risk of the negative health consequences associated with limited physical activity. Policy implications are discussed in terms of mitigating this effect, as well as reducing transport inequity related to vehicle access.

AB  - Attitudes and habits are extremely resistant to change, but a disruption of the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to bring long-term, massive societal changes. During the pandemic, people are being compelled to experience new ways of interacting, working, learning, shopping, traveling, and eating meals. Going forward, a critical question is whether these experiences will result in changed behaviors and preferences in the long term. This paper presents initial findings on the likelihood of long-term changes in telework, daily travel, restaurant patronage, and air travel based on survey data collected from adults in the United States in Spring 2020. These data suggest that a sizable fraction of the increase in telework and decreases in both business air travel and restaurant patronage are likely here to stay. As for daily travel modes, public transit may not fully recover its pre-pandemic ridership levels, but many of our respondents are planning to bike and walk more than they used to. These data reflect the responses of a sample that is higher income and more highly educated than the US population. The response of these particular groups to the COVID-19 pandemic is perhaps especially important to understand, however, because their consumption patterns give them a large influence on many sectors of the economy.

AB  - Compares the model of attitude–behavior relations developed by M. Fishbein and I. Ajzen (1975) with the modifications of the model made by P. M. Bentler and G. Speckart (see record 1980-00949-001). Ss were 236 undergraduates; class attendance was the behavioral measure. An analysis of linear structural relationships, using multiple indicators for each underlying construct, supported the Bentler-Speckart addition to the Fishbein-Ajzen model, with prior behavior as a direct causal influence on both subsequent behavior and behavioral intentions. However, consistent with the original Fishbein-Ajzen model, a significant direct path from attitude to subsequent behavior was not found.

AB  - It is shown that PFA, CFA and AFA are particular cases of a scale-invariant factoring procedure based on variance ratios of certain weighted combinations of variables. Standard derivations in the literature are shown, in contrast, to have unsatisfactory features. It is suggested that the choice between PFA, CFA and AFA involves relatively independent choices of features of each, and that in most cases CFA is to be preferred.

AU  - Ajzen, Icek
T2  - Theories of Cognitive Self-Regulation
AB  - Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.

TI  - Thanks coefficient alpha, we’ll take it from here
AU  - McNeish, Daniel
T2  - Psychological Methods
AB  - Empirical studies in psychology commonly report Cronbach’s alpha as a measure of internal consistency reliability despite the fact that many methodological studies have shown that Cronbach’s alpha is riddled with problems stemming from unrealistic assumptions. In many circumstances, violating these assumptions yields estimates of reliability that are too small, making measures look less reliable than they actually are. Although methodological critiques of Cronbach’s alpha are being cited with increasing frequency in empirical studies, in this tutorial we discuss how the trend is not necessarily improving methodology used in the literature. That is, many studies continue to use Cronbach’s alpha without regard for its assumptions or merely cite methodological articles advising against its use to rationalize unfavorable Cronbach’s alpha estimates. This tutorial first provides evidence that recommendations against Cronbach’s alpha have not appreciably changed how empirical studies report reliability. Then, we summarize the drawbacks of Cronbach’s alpha conceptually without relying on mathematical or simulation-based arguments so that these arguments are accessible to a broad audience. We continue by discussing several alternative measures that make less rigid assumptions which provide justifiably higher estimates of reliability compared to Cronbach’s alpha. We conclude with empirical examples to illustrate advantages of alternative measures of reliability including omega total, Revelle’s omega total, the greatest lower bound, and Coefficient H. A detailed software appendix is also provided to help researchers implement alternative methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Annual Review of Psychology
AB  - This review presents a practical summary of the missing data literature, including a sketch of missing data theory and descriptions of normal-model multiple imputation (MI) and maximum likelihood methods. Practical missing data analysis issues are discussed, most notably the inclusion of auxiliary variables for improving power and reducing bias. Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal, categorical, and clustered data with normal-model MI; including interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers of variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out. Suggestions are given for moving forward with research on missing data and attrition.

TI  - Exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis with missing data: A simple method for SPSS users
AU  - Weaver, Bruce
AU  - Maxwell, Hillary
T2  - The Quantitative Methods for Psychology
AB  - <p>Missing data is a frequent problem for researchers conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA) or reliability analysis. The  SPSS  FACTOR  procedure  allows  users  to  select  listwise  deletion,  pairwise  deletion  or  mean  substitution  as  a  method  for dealing with missing data. The shortcomings of these methods are well-known. Graham (2009) argues that a much better way to deal with missing data in this context is to use a matrix of expectation maximization (EM) covariances(or correlations) as input for the analysis. SPSS users who have the Missing  Values Analysis add-on module can obtain vectors ofEM means and standard deviations plus EM correlation and covariance matrices via the MVA procedure. But unfortunately, MVA  has no /MATRIX subcommand, and therefore cannot write the EM correlations directly to a matrix dataset of the type needed as input to the FACTOR and RELIABILITY procedures. We describe two macros that (in conjunction with an intervening MVA command) carry out the data  management  steps  needed  to  create  two  matrix  datasets,  one  containing  EM  correlations  and  the  other  EM  covariances. Either of those matrix datasets can then be used asinput to the FACTOR procedure, and the EM correlations can also be used as input to RELIABILITY. We provide an example that illustrates the use of the two macros to generate the matrix datasets and how to  use  those  datasets  as  input  to  the  FACTOR  and  RELIABILITY  procedures.   We  hope  that  this  simple  method  for  handling missing data will prove useful to both students andresearchers who are conducting EFA or reliability analysis.</p>

AB  - In this article, we attempt to distinguish between the properties of moderator and mediator variables at a number of levels. First, we seek to make theorists and researchers aware of the importance of not using the terms moderator and mediator interchangeably by carefully elaborating, both conceptually and strategically, the many ways in which moderators and mediators differ. We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.

AB  - Demonstrates the application of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in testing 1st- and higher-order factor models and their invariance across independent groups, using a LISREL (linear structural relations) framework. Data from a study by the 1st author et al (see record 1985-09311-001) gathered from administration of the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ) to 658 Australian children in Grades 2, 3, 4, and 5 were used to examine the factor structure. The original study tested theoretical predications about the structure of self-concept advanced by R. J. Shavelson et al (see record 1978-30429-001) and Shavelson and R. Bolus (see record 1982-22201-001). In the present demonstration, CFA indicated that the basic factor model hypothesized to underlie the SDQ provided a good fit to the data across 4 age groups. Model 5, which proposes that there are 2 academic factors at the 2nd-order level that combine with the nonacademic factor to form a General Self factor at the 3rd-order level, was found to provide the best fit. Means and standard deviations for the 28 subscales of the SDQ are appended. (63 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Principles for reporting analyses using structural equation modeling are reviewed, with the goal of supplying readers with complete and accurate information. It is recommended that every report give a detailed justification of the model used, along with plausible alternatives and an account of identifiability. Nonnormality and missing data problems should also be addressed. A complete set of parameters and their standard errors is desirable, and it will often be convenient to supply the correlation matrix and discrepancies, as well as goodness-of-fit indices, so that readers can exercise independent critical judgment. A survey of fairly representative studies compares recent practice with the principles of reporting recommended here. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T2  - Psychological Bulletin
AB  - Factor analysis, path analysis, structural equation modeling, and related multivariate statistical methods are based on maximum likelihood or generalized least squares estimation developed for covariance structure models (CSMs). Large-sample theory provides a chi-square goodness-of-fit test for comparing a model (M) against a general alternative M based on correlated variables. It is suggested that this comparison is insufficient for M evaluation. A general null M based on modified independence among variables is proposed as an additional reference point for the statistical and scientific evaluation of CSMs. Use of the null M in the context of a procedure that sequentially evaluates the statistical necessity of various sets of parameters places statistical methods in covariance structure analysis into a more complete framework. The concepts of ideal Ms and pseudo chi-square tests are introduced, and their roles in hypothesis testing are developed. The importance of supplementing statistical evaluation with incremental fit indices associated with the comparison of hierarchical Ms is also emphasized. Normed and nonnormed fit indices are developed and illustrated. (43 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A structural equation model is proposed with a generalized measurement part, allowing for dichotomous and ordered categorical variables (indicators) in addition to continuous ones. A computationally feasible three-stage estimator is proposed for any combination of observed variable types. This approach provides large-sample chi-square tests of fit and standard errors of estimates for situations not previously covered. Two multiple-indicator modeling examples are given. One is a simultaneous analysis of two groups with a structural equation model underlying skewed Likert variables. The second is a longitudinal model with a structural model for multivariate probit regressions.

AB  - Introduction
Although there is evidence for distinct behavioural sub-phenotypes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), their inter-relationships and the effect of clinical variables on their expression have been little investigated.
Methods
We have analysed a sample of 1850 probable AD patients from the UK and Greece with 10 item Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) data. We applied a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) approach to investigate the effect of MMSE, disease duration, gender, age and age of onset on the structure of a four-factor model consisting of “psychosis”, “moods”, “agitation” and “behavioural dyscontrol”.
Results
Specific clinical variables predicted the expression of individual factors. When the inter-relationship of factors is modelled, some previously significant associations are lost. For example, lower MMSE scores predict psychosis, agitation and behavioural dyscontrol factors, but psychosis and mood predict the agitation factor. Taking these associations into account MMSE scores did not predict agitation.
Conclusions
The complexity of the inter-relations between symptoms, factors and clinical variables is efficiently captured by this MIMIC model.

TI  - Perceived Behavioral Control, Self-Efficacy, Locus of Control, and the Theory of Planned Behavior1
AU  - Ajzen, Icek
T2  - Journal of Applied Social Psychology
AB  - Conceptual and methodological ambiguities surrounding the concept of perceived behavioral control are clarified. It is shown that perceived control over performance of a behavior, though comprised of separable components that reflect beliefs about self-efficacy and about controllability, can nevertheless be considered a unitary latent variable in a hierarchical factor model. It is further argued that there is no necessary correspondence between self-efficacy and internal control factors, or between controllability and external control factors. Self-efficacy and controllability can reflect internal as well as external factors and the extent to which they reflect one or the other is an empirical question. Finally, a case is made that measures of perceived behavioral control need to incorporate self-efficacy as well as controllability items that are carefully selected to ensure high internal consistency. Summary and Conclusions Perceived control over performance of a behavior can account for consider- able variance in intentions and actions. However, ambiguities surrounding the concept of perceived behavioral control have tended to create uncertainties and to impede progress. The present article attempted to clarify conceptual ambiguities and resolve issues related to the operationalization of perceived behavioral control. Recent research has demonstrated that the overarching concept of perceived behavioral control, as commonly assessed, is comprised of two components: self-efficacy (dealing largely with the ease or difficulty of performing a behavior) and controllability (the extent to which performance is up to the actor). Contrary to a widely accepted view, it was argued that self-efficacy expectations do not necessarily correspond to beliefs about internal control factors, and that controllability expectations have no necessary basis in the perceived operation of external factors. Instead, it was suggested that self-efficacy and controllability may both reflect beliefs about the presence of internal as well as external factors. Rather than making a priori assumptions about the internal or external locus of self-efficacy and controllability, this issue is best treated as an empirical question. Also of theoretical significance, the present article tried to dispel the notion that self-efficacy and controllability are incompatible with, or independent of, each other. Although factor analyses of perceived behavioral control items provide clear and consistent evidence for the distinction, there is sufficient commonality between self-efficacy and controllability to suggest a two-level hierarchical model. In this model, perceived behavioral control is the overarching, superordinate construct that is comprised of two lower-level components: self-efficacy and controllability. This view of the control component in the theory of planned behavior implies that measures of perceived behavioral control should contain items that assess self-efficacy as well as controllability. Depending on the purpose of the investigation, a decision can be made to aggregate over all items, treating perceived behavioral control as a unitary factor, or to distinguish between self-efficacy and controllability by entering separate indices into the prediction equation.

TI  - Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change
AU  - Bandura, Albert
T2  - Psychological Review
AB  - Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

AB  - Beliefs about control have been related to many aspects of health, including health behavior, health outcomes, and health care. In general, the greater one's sense of control, the more likely one will engage in appropriate behavior and the better one's outcomes. However, the relationship between control beliefs, behavior, and outcomes is not always straightforward. This article covers the following topics: locus of control; self-efficacy, mastery, and competence; perceived behavioral control; perceived situational control; helplessness; assessing control beliefs; and altering control beliefs.

After describing an integrative model of behavioral prediction, the model’s implications for designing persuasive communications are considered. Using data from a study on smoker’s intentions to continue smoking and to quit, it is shown how the theory helps identify the critical beliefs underlying these or other intentions. Finally, it is argued that although behavioral theory can help identify the beliefs that should be targeted in a persuasive communication, our ability to change these beliefs will ultimately rest on communication theory.

AB  - Evaluated the validity of a prevalent model of attitude structure that specifies 3 components: affect, behavior, and cognition. Five conditions needed for properly testing the 3-component distinction were identified. Consideration of the tripartite model's theoretical basis indicated that the most important validating conditions are (a) the use of nonverbal, in addition to verbal, measures of affect and behavior; and (b) the physical presence of the attitude object. Study 1–in which 138 undergraduates attitudes toward snakes were examined, through the use of measures such as the Mood Adjective Check List, semantic differential, and distance of approach–indicated very strong support for this tripartite model. The model was statistically acceptable, its relative fit was very good, and the intercomponent correlations were moderate. Study 2, with 105 Ss, was a verbal report analog of Study 1. Results from Study 2 indicate that higher intercomponent correlations occurred when attitude measures derived solely from verbal reports and when the attitude object was not physically present.

TI  - Factors Affecting Bicycling Demand: Initial Survey Findings from the Portland, Oregon, Region
AU  - Dill, Jennifer

T2  - Transportation Research Record
AB  - The levels of bicycling in the United States, particularly for nonrecreation purposes and among adults, are low. Only about 1% of the trips that people make in the United States are on bicycles, and less than 5% of trips under 1/2 mi are made on bicycles. Factors influencing the rates of cycling include demographics and environmental factors. Environmental factors can be measured both objectively (e.g., number of miles of bike lanes, average temperature, and street connectivity) and subjectively (e.g., people's ratings or perceptions of the bicycling environment). People's attitudes about travel and mobility likely play a role. This paper uses the results from a random phone survey of adults in the Portland, Oregon, region to explore the relationships between levels of cycling and demographics, objective environmental factors, perceptions of the environment, and attitudes. The survey revealed several significant differences, although additional analysis is necessary. Objective measures of proximity to off-street trails and bike lanes was not associated with higher levels of cycling. However, positive perceptions of the availability of bike lanes was associated with more cycling and the desire to cycle more. Higher levels of street connectivity were associated with more cycling for utilitarian trips.

AB  - While there have been considerable efforts to promote bicycle helmet use in the United States in recent years, little information has been available on actual helmet usage patterns. Based on the results of a recent national survey, this article provides information on current helmet usage patterns, the types of helmets in use, and the reasons why bicycle riders use or do not use helmets. It also presents a statistical analysis of the factors associated with helmet use. These factors are determined and quantified with a probit regression model, a type of qualitative response model that can be used to estimate the expected probabilities of helmet use for individual bicyclists and for various population subgroups. The regression analysis shows that helmet use is systematically related to riding patterns, rider characteristics, and household demographics.

AB  - While national estimates of bicycle-related injuries and deaths are readily available, information about the characteristics and use patterns of bicyclists is not regularly monitored. This article describes the results of a national survey of U.S. bicycle riders conducted in 1998. The survey employed a single-stage list-assisted random digit-dial sample design, and collected information about some of the characteristics and bicycle use patterns of a probability sample of over 1,000 U.S. bicyclists. The results of the survey provide information about: the population of bicyclists; selected characteristics of riders (e.g., age, gender, experience); bicycle use patterns (how much and where bicycles are ridden); helmet usage patterns; and the demographic characteristics of rider households. The results of the survey are evaluated in conjunction with national injury estimates to calculate bicycle-related injury rates. The results are also compared to those of a similar survey conducted in 1991 to evaluate changes in bicycle and helmet use patterns over time.

AB  - The predictive power of the Ajzen, Triandis, and Schwartz models are compared in the context of car use for university routes. Two hundred fifty-four students filled out a questionnaire designed to measure the components of the three models. In the prediction of intention to use a car, results indicated that one variable from the Trinandis model?role beliefs?increased the explanatory power offered by the components of the Ajzen model. In the prediction of self-reported car use, one variable of the Triandis model?car use habit?significantly increased the predictive power of the Ajzen model. The central variable of the Schwartz model?personal norm?exerted no significant effect either on intention or on behavior. The implications of the findings for interventions to reduce the car use of students for university routes are discussed.

T2  - Environment and Behavior
AB  - In the domain of travel mode choice behavior, the interaction between ecological norm orientation and the external aspects ?fare? and ?subway station range? was investigated in an experimental field study. The ecological norm orientation is conceptualized based on the Schwartz theory on altruistic behavior, which is then applied to the environmental context. In a random sample of 160 persons, fare was experimentally manipulated by distributing free public transport tickets, whereas the station range was varied by selecting test participants at different distances from a station. Within the norm activation model, the mobility-specific personal ecological norm proves to be the strongest predictor of travel mode choice as recorded in standardized questionnaires. Reducing the fare by distributing free tickets has a quantitatively similar effect. The results suggest that the ?economy-plus-moral? formula best describes the fact that the integrative mechanism (external factor fare plus normative ecological orientation) is the determinant of travel mode choice.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine psychosocial and environmental predictors of cycling for transportation. A sample of 343 Flemish adults (43% men) living at maximum 10 km from their workplace was surveyed. Self-report measures of cycling, demographic variables, psychosocial variables, self-efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers and environmental attributes (destination, traffic variables and facilities at the workplace) of cycling for transport were obtained by means of a mailing questionnaire. Modeling and social support by accompanying, external self-efficacy, ecological–economic awareness and lack of time and interest were positively associated with the likelihood of cycling for transport and varied in importance between cyclists and non-cyclists. Cyclists estimate the time to destination shorter than non-cyclists and indicate to have more facilities for cyclists at the workplace. The results suggest that when people live in a setting with adequate bicycle infrastructure, individual determinants (psychosocial, self-efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers) outperform the role of environmental determinants in this sample. Promotion campaigns aimed at increasing cycling for transportation should focus on creating social support by encouraging cycling with partners, increasing self-efficacy, raising ecological and economic awareness, decreasing lack of time and interest barriers and providing facilities for cyclists at the workplace.

AB  - A sample of 188 students were used to predict their intentions of using either an automobile or bike to attend university functions. The theory of planned individual behavior was used to test the utility theories directly. In addition to discussing operationalizing of the individual behavior theory the modeling of cause of the theory and empirical test of causal structure with structural equation models are described. It was found that almost 80 percent of the variance of the plan to use an automobile or bicycle can be explained. It was also discovered that a good fit of the model could be accomplished only through use of direct paths which are not found in the original theory.

AB  - Background
The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions in many countries and is largely due to behavioral factors that disrupt the energy balance. The purpose of the study was to test how well our conceptual model, combining features from the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Theory of Triadic Influence, explained two behaviors related to the energy balance, namely bicycle use for transportation and snacking behavior in a Dutch adolescent sample.
Methods
Data was gathered in an 1997 cross-sectional sample of adolescents (n = 3,859; mean age 14.8 years SD = 1.6) on snacking behavior, bicycle use, demographics, and potential environmental, cognitive and psychological determinants. Data was analyzed using bivariate correlations, multiple linear and binary logistic regression analyses.
Results
Less snacking behavior was associated with female gender and a more positive intention, a more positive attitude, and stronger perceived behavioral control towards restricting snacking. Students who used their bicycle for transportation were more likely to attend secondary education, to be native Dutch, to go to school in a less-urbanized city, to be younger, had a more positive intention and perceived stronger behavioral control and subjective norm towards bicycle use.
Conclusions
The inclusion of environmental factors increased our understanding of bicycle use for transportation and snacking behavior in adolescents. The environmental factors are suggested to be taken into account in interventions aimed at changing these behaviors in more healthy directions.

TI  - Contemplating cycling to work: Attitudes and perceptions in different stages of change
AU  - Gatersleben, Birgitta

T2  - Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice
AB  - In 1996 the UK government introduced the National Cycle Strategy which aimed to double the number of cycling trips by the end of 2002 and double them again by 2012. So far, however, these targets have not been met. The House of Commons ascribes this to ‘a fundamental lack of commitment to cycling on an individual, regional and national level’. This paper addresses the individual level by examining the views of commuters in different stages of change as distinguished by Prochaska’s model [Prochaska, J.O., DiClemente, C.C., 1984. The Transtheoretical Approach: Crossing Traditional Boundaries of Change. Dow Jones/Irwin, Homewood IL]. This model views behaviour change as a process rather than an event. Two studies were conducted amongst university staff and students: a survey study and an action study. The studies showed that as people progress from precontemplation to action their attitudes towards cycling become more positive and their perceptions of various personal and external barriers change. This suggests that different strategies are necessary to move people in different stages of change to action and maintenance. At the moment, it seems that regular cyclists form a very small minority of people who will cycle under most circumstances simply because they like cycling. The majority of people have never contemplated cycling. There is, however, also a group of people who would like to cycle and could be persuaded to cycle under the right circumstances.

AB  - Background
Many health behaviors have a history of repetition and, as a result, may become habitual. Because including a measure of habit strength may add depth to current theoretical models on health behavior, the present study explored the issue of habit strength within the context of the theory of planned behavior regarding adult bicycle use as a means of transportation.
Methods
Cross-sectional data were gathered in a Dutch adult sample (n=317; mean age=42.09 years; 46.7% men) in 2006 using self-administered questionnaires. Variables for the theory of planned behavior were assessed regarding bicycle use as a means of transportation; habit strength regarding bicycle use as a means of transportation was assessed with the validated Self-Reported Habit Index. Hierarchical regression analyses and interaction analyses using simple slope analyses were conducted.
Results
After controlling for variables for the theory of planned behavior, habit strength was the strongest predictor of bicycle use. In addition, simple slope analyses based on a significant interaction term, intention × habit, showed that intention was a significant predictor of bicycle use among those at low levels of habit strength for bicycle use (β=0.67, p<0.001) but a weaker and nonsignificant predictor at high levels of habit strength (β=0.10, p=0.136).
Conclusions
Habit strength is a moderator of the intention–behavior relationship regarding bicycle use, with intention becoming less relevant when bicycle use increases in habit strength. Future determinant and intervention studies on physical activity may benefit from including a measure of habit strength—for instance, by identifying the differential effects of informational and environmental interventions.

AU  - Beck, Matthew J.

T2  - Transport Policy
AB  - While many countries have experienced more than one wave of the pandemic throughout 2020, Australia has been able to contain the virus in a way that makes it a stand out (with New Zealand) in the way that it has been contained, with an exception in Victoria linked to failed quarantine procedures for travellers returning from overseas. Through descriptive analysis, this paper builds on earlier papers by the authors on the Australian response, with a focus on the changing dynamics of travel activity, concern with public transport, and attitudes surrounding activity given the perception of risk of COVID-19 and the level of public support for regulatory intervention and restrictions on movement. We find that Australia continues to suppress travel, particularly that for commuting, that comfort in completing day-to-day activities continues to rise (with the exception of Victoria where confidence feel significantly), and while support for intervention measures remains high, there has been an erosion in sentiment. As with previous work, we discuss what this might mean for future transport policy, and attempt to draw lessons from the Australian experience.

AB  - The need to recognise and account for the influence of working from home on commuting activity has never been so real as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only does this change the performance of the transport network, it also means that the way in which transport modellers and planners use models estimated on a typical weekday of travel and expand it up to the week and the year must be questioned and appropriately revised to adjust for the quantum of working from home. Although teleworking is not a new phenomenon, what is new is the ferocity by which it has been imposed on individuals throughout the world, and the expectation that working from home is no longer a temporary phenomenon but one that is likely to continue to some non-marginal extent given its acceptance and revealed preferences from both many employees and employ where working from home makes good sense. This paper formalises the relationship between working from home and commuting by day of the week and time of day for two large metropolitan areas in Australia, Brisbane and Sydney, using a mixed logit choice model, identifying the influences on such choices together with a mapping model between the probability of working from home and socioeconomic and other contextual influences that are commonly used in strategic transport models to predict demand for various modes by location. The findings, based on Wave 3 (approximately 6 months from the initial outbreak of the pandemic) of an ongoing data collection exercise, provide the first formal evidence for Australia in enabling transport planners to adjust their predicted modal shares and overall modal travel activity for the presence of working from home.

AB  - In western societies, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic restrictions created a boom in cycling activity and business. This article reports findings from an Australia-wide survey that invited responses from those who changed their cycling behaviour during the pandemic lockdowns. The survey premise was that the pandemic lockdowns in each state presented the conditions of a ‘natural experiment’ to test whether the reduction in automobile traffic affected how cyclists reported experiencing the cycling environment. The survey was in the field from 3 August to 16 September 2020 with purposive sampling. A total of 699 respondents participated, with 444 complete surveys. Key questions we seek to address include: Did cycling activity increase during the pandemic shutdowns? How did cyclists from under-represented groups experience the pandemic lockdowns? The findings are twofold. First, cycling activity increased among most respondents during pandemic lockdowns for exercise and wellbeing, but not for transport. Our survey reports that for respondents the pandemic lockdowns did not result in an uptake of active transport, despite the appearance of ‘pop-up’ cycle lanes. Second, the reduced traffic of the pandemic shutdown period created a particular opportunity for women to ride bikes. The key policy implication is that cities in Australia should be designed for more relaxed modalities of mobility if the goal is to increase rates of active travel and cycling activity.

T2  - Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice
AB  - COVID related lockdowns have forced many workers around the world into work from home (WFH) arrangements. While the proportion of people who work from home has typically been very low (4.5% in Melbourne in 2016), it is worth considering how trends might change once the world emerges out of COVID lockdowns. This paper aims to examine (1) the long-term impacts of COVID on WFH and (2) the psycho-social factors which will impact workers’ intention to increase WFH post-COVID. The paper uses the Theory of Planned Behaviour as a lens to examine these psycho-social determinants. The study uses the survey responses of 1,364 workers which were collected in June-August 2020 as part of a larger survey (n = 2,158), which aimed to capture a representative population of Greater Melbourne. Quasi-longitudinal investigation of self-reported WFH frequency revealed that WFH as a share of average weekday employment increased 310% during COVID lockdown. In the longer term, when COVID is no longer an issue, WFH can be expected to be 75% higher than pre-COVID levels. Structural Equation Modelling was applied to the Theory of Planned Behaviour to understand motivators for and barriers to increasing WFH post-COVID. Perceived Behavioural Control (e.g. job type, technology, access to materials) and Subjective Norms (e.g. employer and family support) will be crucial determinants of the intention to work from home post-COVID. Attitudes regarding WFH will only have a weak impact on future intention to work from home, a finding which contrasts with previous research.

TI  - Sustainable mobility in auto-dominated Metro Boston: Challenges and opportunities post-COVID-19
AU  - Basu, Rounaq
AU  - Ferreira, Joseph
T2  - Transport Policy
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted society as we knew it in a variety of ways, with especially severe impacts on low-income households. Even before COVID-19, Metro Boston was witnessing a rise in private car ownership and decreasing mass transit ridership, further exacerbated by a historical spatial mismatch that made low-income commuters relatively more dependent on mass transit. Accounts of overcrowded buses and trains since early March have heightened psychological dread among regular transit commuters, some of whom have already purchased a private car or intend to do so within the next year. Uncertainty around transit service frequency and erosion of trust in the MBTA are the primary challenges for rebuilding transit rider confidence, which is likely to be a long and slow process. Low transit ridership levels can lead to fiscal challenges on the horizon and consequent service cuts, which necessitate the need for adopting a multi-modal approach to affordable and sustainable urban mobility. A narrow window is available to discourage a further shift to cars that will further cannibalize transit. Given the diversity of mobility services available in Metro Boston, designing a MaaS pilot with close attention to technological integration and cost salience can be crucial in showcasing the value of multi-modal and cross-modal accessibility. Such programs must be synergistic with concurrent transit service improvements and car-commute disincentives, such as in-town parking charges and road-use charges, without impeding access to affordable mobility for low-income and essential workers. Looking at the various agile policy responses of several cities in Metro Boston over the last few months, we are cautiously optimistic that sustainable mobility will become a major theme in urban and regional mobility policies in the post-COVID recovery period.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic marked a global disruption of unprecedented scale which was closely associated with human mobility. Since mobility acts as a facilitator for spreading the virus, individuals were forced to reconsider their respective behaviors. Despite numerous studies having detected behavioral changes during the first lockdown period (spring 2020), there is a lack of longitudinal perspectives that can provide insights into the intra-pandemic dynamics and potential long-term effects. This article investigates COVID-19-induced mobility-behavioral transformations by analyzing travel patterns of Berlin residents during a 20-month pandemic period and comparing them to the pre-pandemic situation. Based on quantitative analysis of almost 800,000 recorded trips, our longitudinal examination revealed individuals having reduced average monthly travel distances by ∼20%, trip frequencies by ∼11%, and having switched to individual modes. Public transportation has suffered a continual regression, with trip frequencies experiencing a relative long-term reduction of ∼50%, and a respective decrease of traveled distances by ∼43%. In contrast, the bicycle (rather than the car) was the central beneficiary, indicated by bicycle-related trip frequencies experiencing a relative long-term increase of ∼53%, and travel distances increasing by ∼117%. Comparing behavioral responses to three pandemic waves, our analysis revealed each wave to have created unique response patterns, which show a gradual softening of individuals’ mobility related self-restrictions. Our findings contribute to retracing and quantifying individuals’ changing mobility behaviors induced by the pandemic, and to detecting possible long-term effects that may constitute a “new normal” of an entirely altered urban mobility landscape.

T2  - American Journal of Health Promotion
AB  - Health promotion programs often lack a clearly specified theoretical foundation or are based on narrowly conceived conceptual models. For example, lifestyle modification programs typically emphasize individually focused behavior change strategies, while neglecting the environmental underpinnings of health and illness. This article compares three distinct, yet complementary, theoretical perspectives on health promotion: behavioral change, environmental enhancement, and social ecological models. Key strengths and limitations of each perspective are examined, and core principles of social ecological theory are used to derive practical guidelines for designing and evaluating community health promotion programs. Directions for future health promotion research are discussed, including studies examining the role of intermediaries (e.g., corporate decision-makers, legislators) in promoting the well-being of others, and those evaluating the duration and scope of intervention outcomes.

T2  - Psychological Bulletin
AB  - In confirmatory factor analysis, hypothesized models reflect approximations to reality so that any model can be rejected if the sample size is large enough. In the present article, we examine the influence of sample size on different fit indexes for both real and simulated data. Contrary to claims by Bentler and Bonett (1980), their incremental fit index was substantially affected by sample size. Contrary to claims by Joreskog and Sorbom (1981), their goodness-of-fit indexes provided by {lisrel} were substantially affected by sample size. Contrary to claims by Bollen (1986), his new incremental fit index was substantially affected by sample size. Hoelter's (1983) critical N index was also substantially affected by sample size. Of the more than 30 indexes considered, the Tucker-Lewis (1973) index was the only widely used index that was relatively independent of sample size. However, four new indexes based on the same form as the Tucker-Lewis index were also relatively independent of sample size. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The book's goal is to introduce readers to the building blocks of structural equation modeling (SEM) so they can conduct their own analysis and understand and critique related research. Utilizing an application oriented approach, each chapter covers basic concepts, principles, and practices, and then utilizes SEM software to provide examples. Most chapters follow the SEM basic steps: specification; identification; estimation; testing; and modification. A checklist is included to guide the reader's model analysis according to the basic steps a researcher takes. The text includes numerous examples using Amos, EQS, and LISREL software. The book's early chapters provide an understanding how missing data, non-normality, scale of measurement, non-linearity, outliers, and restrictions of range in scores affect SEM analysis. Chapters 6 through 10 follow the basic SEM steps of modeling using regression, path, confirmatory factor, and structural equation models. Chapter 12 introduces several approaches to model validation, the final step in obtaining an acceptable theoretical model. The book concludes with a description of the matrix approach to SEM by using examples from previous chapters. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Principles for reporting analyses using structural equation modeling are reviewed, with the goal of supplying readers with complete and accurate information. It is recommended that every report give a detailed justification of the model used, along with plausible alternatives and an account of identifiability. Nonnormality and missing data problems should also be addressed. A complete set of parameters and their standard errors is desirable, and it will often be convenient to supply the correlation matrix and discrepancies, as well as goodness-of-fit indices, so that readers can exercise independent critical judgment. A survey of fairly representative studies compares recent practice with the principles of reporting recommended here. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)
