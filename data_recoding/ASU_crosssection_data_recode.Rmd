The wave 1 dataset - cross section outputs

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
df_wave1 <- read.csv("./../dataset_main/covid_pooled_public_w1b_1.1.0b7.csv", fileEncoding = 'UTF-8-BOM') #wave 1b 
df_wave2 <- read.csv("./../dataset_main/covidfuture_wave_2_public_Main_2.0.0b6.csv", fileEncoding = 'UTF-8-BOM') #wave 2
df_wave3 <- read.csv("./../dataset_main/covidfuture_wave_3_public_Main_3.0.0b6.csv") #wave 3
```

The dataset records unanswered and unshown results. replace all of these answers with "NA".

```{r}
# replace the not responding value with NA 
df_wave1[df_wave1 == "Question not displayed to respondent"] <- NA
df_wave1[df_wave1 == "Variable not available in datasource"] <- NA
df_wave1[df_wave1 == "Seen but unanswered"] <- NA
df_wave1[df_wave1 == "Not selected"] <- NA
df_wave1[df_wave1 == "Nonmetropolitan"] <- NA
# remove the columns of missing data descriptions 
# remove the variable for showing attention ("trap_")
df_wave1 %<>%
  select(-contains("_miss"), -contains("trap_"), -contains("_trap"))

```
